- 👋 Hi, I’m @ernestoandre, an industrial engineer from Perú. During this pandemic I discovered an enormous interest for 
Data Analysis, I took some courses online by my own to know the basics of Python and SQL. I want to practice and apply 
these knowledge by doing some indidual projects.
- 👀 I’m very interested in Python and SQL language as well as other softwares for data visualization such as Power BI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of Data Science in Python.
